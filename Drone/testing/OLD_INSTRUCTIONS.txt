For the testing to work, you need to open a mosquitto broker.
This can be done by in a terminal by writing: mosquitto -v

Then, you also need the deub tool. In our case, we are using mqttui.
Open a terminal and execute app.py, which is found in the mqttui folder.
Then open a browser and connect via: localhost:5000

The local server broker and debug setup is now complete.

In order to flash the esp32, you will need to use esptool.py.
This tool can be found in the Scripts folder of your python installation.

In a terminal, execute: where python

Look for the Scripts folder within the python folder.

Use mpremote to test and upload code to the esp32.
In a terminal, simply write: mpremote

To see the model of the esp32, use: esptool.py --port COMx chip_id
