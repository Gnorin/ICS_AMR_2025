For the testing to work, you need to open a mosquitto broker.
This can be done by in a terminal by writing: mosquitto -v

Then, you also need the deub tool. In our case, we are using mqttui.
Open a terminal and execute app.py, which is found in the mqttui folder.
Then open a browser and connect via: localhost:5000

The local server broker and debug setup is now complete.
